@ArtRanger6 haha yeah
@WoodFeels it’s my pleasure
@jon_flores4 good start
@Inanity101 @TheElZilcho I’ve never trusted anyone more
@human_millipede That’s true!
@TheElZilcho damn
@TheElZilcho Up to you, the reader, to decide
@bigjackash hes heating up
limo driver walks into a bar and the bar tender says “why the long car?”
@Ra5hdecisions Ooh yeah
@bathpont_skiman Good to know!
@x_Cute_Man_x Wow thanks
@paynus2 I could do that if needed

@GuiltyOfDUI Still a lot of day left but thanks
little red riding hood: why grandma.. what a long car you have 
limo driver, disguised as little red riding hood’s grandma: the better to drive you around town in luxury, my dear
@breeeemer why not
@ThijsMe not right now
@drewhillenburg Yes
@F14T12 Yep
@tim_oyler Yeah
@timbreine I wouldn’t doubt it
@CharlieVindaloo Thanks
@garagesnail You’re thinking of trucks
@danchovy anything to do with groceries is fine by me
@raymondedwards it’s not about efficiency it’s about length
im not like most limo drivers who are only in it for the money and outside of work drive a regular car. im in it for  pure love of the car length and drive a limo as a personal vehicle as well
@kdonnn Fraid not
@garagecollage Any time , man
@elgordito_gordo not to me it couldn’t
@FunnyTerro i don’t
@Sick_Mith You got it
@bigjackash just the length of the cars
@realEddieBrown I wouldn’t know
the shorter the car the less likely it is to be a “limousine”
@stevenlee23188 no
@paynus2 Maybe a peg
@paynus2 I did see one. Might riff on it a little bit
(limo driver rolls down partition) how’s the car length?
@brother_dag Can’t wait
@LukeC___ I live in Las Vegas. It don’t rain
@brother_dag Unleaded gas

@timjarvis86 i sure do
@Flora__Flora you gotta love this world
@JakeWolfsuck so I’m not as cool as i thought i guess
@neiljung3 what a relief
after eating chips and salsa or chips and guacamole i always end with one plain tortilla chip with no dip on it to cleanse my palate
@hezicka my kids never want to go in like march
@timbreine it’s come in handy for me if i need a Halloween costume
@dannyzyall don’t hurt
@owen96522648 That’s your right
sure Spirit Halloween is only open one month out of the whole year but you can’t say that they don’t pick the best month of the year for that kind of business to be open
@CharlieVindaloo No this buddy is texting me back immediately
@BentzICT will do
texting my buddy to see what he’s doing to get ready for bed tonight
@woodmuffin Hard to believe this exchange was just Yesterday
@MichaelSmartGuy Maybe. I hope nothing’s wrong
@Hold_BL_Up_Up No idea
@bigjackash The time has come
usually at this same time each day my neighbor donald trump and i pull into  our driveways from work but i don’t see his car there today
@cat_pubes_ that’d be crazy
@IO9u0FnN7y51yaY Hoping some people who see this tweet consider it
@hollyroik might not take you seriously if you’re that polite
@MakeItUnclear He’s right
@MakeItUnclear What’d he say?
@nilbog3000 did i stutter
(me robbing a store) gimme all the items in here
@swampwitchgame Cant carry a gas can in there probably
@kpducc doubt it the way they were talking
@GnarlyWhitehur1 Open and shut
@donmexlar if the guy robbed a gas station where’s this gas
the news just said a guy robbed a gas station then they showed footage of the guy and he wasnt carrying any gas. thats not your guy. no gas
(to guy pumping gas at pump next to me) hey can i try a little gas? See if i want to get a full tank?
@StrasiTunity yeah i guess it does
@rad_milk One can dream
@erik_normal Don’t like to do that to people
@InflatableCobra cheers
@TheHoshuah Fraid so
@TheHoshuah It’s etched in stone

you got it, guys. on my way https://t.co/FWUyhgutUl
@dannyzyall Might do the trick
@paynus2 to me this isn’t them

@Laser_Cat around then
@Laser_Cat More of a day time tweet
@paynus2 wish i was doing it as a bit. what a great bit to come up with
@patrickkeefe that’s the problem here. I always am doing bits !
@Doctor_Sound Im just breathing
@drewhillenburg i swear I’m not. Good bit though
my wife’s getting mad at me for breathing at the same time as her. she thinks I’m doing a bit
@DodgersKings323 maybe a little
@susiemmilligan just an excuse to get together but we will talk about the universe
@pharmasean you bet
@happydansko no prob
@pharmasean I’ll put it out to the buddies
@pharmasean in a fight?
@surfduder not too much. don’t wanna step on Einstein’s toes
@TRAV15TY_ what are buddies for
@patrickkrumm that’s your prerogative
@CharlieVindaloo where? Would love to see it
@70Ceeks some days it is like that but i don’t know about today
@lunch_enjoyer He better watch out if he knocks on my door to talk about pavement. i may not let him leave !
@pharmasean nice picture from your childhood!
Life Hack: wheel your garbage to the curb on garbage day and the garbage men will come get it
@subjacktive not cool
@abfrom3 Yeah i don’t want it
wheeling my garbage to the curb and just praying somebody, anybody will come take it. like the garbage men maybe
I just wheel my garbage to the curb. What the garbage men do with it from there is between them and god
@BraOfNachos Nope they wouldn’t
@ItsPhetz a lot of “remakes” out here so far lol

@VerefiedHusband please forgive me
@timbreine taste is a strong sense
@Scurieing haven’t heard of that one
@VerefiedHusband but the article didn’t come out til today 🤔
@NotNamedJames the one on the right and the one on the left
@notpawgbert pop tarts
they actually still make a couple of these https://t.co/HAAr5yjxMl
@McKnightVision probably why they don’t make them anymore
@TheFluffyG guilty
@chalycees @josh_wick they changed it to “most popular pie from ever decade” instead of “decade you were born” because of my tweet
@sarahashsummer Pudding pie i think
@pharmasean too bad we can’t go back to childhood and have them
@pharmasean Pringle’s
@sarahashsummer No just Pringles
I’m familiar with this one but i was pretty into snacks as a kid https://t.co/dl6j2zpYG5

@unreallydean forgot to crop the first one
@ub3rlegen sounds familiar
not ringing a bell. sorry https://t.co/hwdj5YmjwT
@unreallydean now that sounds familiar
@Gamplayr you should go read the article and remember Doritos
@StrasiTunity i dont remember it being in a can or a plastic bottle like it is now because I’m not familiar with that snack
@gltph remember some other snacks i guess
@dylliewillie Yeah i wasn’t alive in the 60s
@Hofoogu I just got it so i don’t know
@paynus2 It’s not very new but still really popular apparently

@pmilardo @dvmlifestyle Thanks
@pmilardo @dvmlifestyle not gonna remember that sorry
@dehlome my pizza totals are usually 5 digits :/
@DrGhostbaby Probably a 5 in top 4 on the sides
@DrGhostbaby i went with “here’s a tip for ya..get a haircut!”
making the pizza guy wait on the porch a considerable amount of time while i stand at the door, holding the knob, deciding whether to use “how much will this set me back” or “what’s the damage”
@swampwitchgame one a day
@blanknam3d you saw the answer
@samelpan thanks mom!
@clint_bing any soccer team I’ve been on was better off with only one me
everyday i break a piggy bank with “lunch money” written on it with a hammer then go buy lunch
@lordbeef I’d know there was a good reason for anything the other cars do
@bigjackash I mean I’m only one man
imagining how smoothly traffic would be going if it was me driving every car out here
after a big bird watching trip you don’t want to see another bird for quite awhile
@Nmal1123 all it takes is one
(feeling sick after bird watching trip) must’ve seen too many birds this weekend
@HoldSpice ive really done that before. Not as a bit
@HoldSpice haven’t opened it back up yet
@paynus2 Taking my wife there tomorrow and saying it if you don’t mind
@PajamaStew and every year i stay the same age

@AlbertDesu Friday after the big meal isn’t a day off

@dereknason Please
the exits on the freeway are there for drivers who can’t handle the high speeds anymore
@acomplexcollin shouldn’t be too hard since they’re completely stopped
How am i stuck in a traffic jam of hundreds of cars on my way to work when there are only 10 people who even work at my job
as a pacific time zone guy it’s my opinion that east coasters look dumb as hell eating lunch at 9 in the morning
@audiosprite Good luck

@DrGhostbaby cmon man
in my perfect world there’d be the same amount of cars out on the road everyday but every person out there would be driving around with no destination, just for the pure love of driving rather than on their way somewhere
i consider it a “spoiler” if somebody tells me a movie exists that i didn’t know existed
@afraidofwasps my first ingredient is to wish for more ingredients 😈
@peeweehuman I won’t
@TheAthleticMLB @MLB in my opinion he probably should’ve hit a solo homer or at most 2 run shot instead of the grand slam
@McKnightVision Lived experience
@melip0ne @YesNoSuper then you could slide your chair through the snow back into the building, Put the wheels back on to roll when your inside and roll to your filing cabinet, get the document, then roll back to the door, put the skis on then slide back to your desk
@2tonbug Have someone on roller skates bring a desk with a computer that clips on your car door
@YesNoSuper i can’t imagine they’d be very good in sand
@BuckyIsotope Id still prefer a car
@hotdogboris Tooth hurty
(calling dentist office for appointment) you guys still interested in seeing my teeth
@WeinerBarf420 I will
@WeinerBarf420 Closed
@cakemittens got to keep getting new ones because you can’t really do this more than once with someone
@ssudzy3 Just a mo’ai fan
@LB_Denberg Let me look again
@LB_Denberg this was wrong
@JisterMusic Scout’s honor
@mynameistopher Close enough!
@DrGhostbaby Probably could but don’t have time right now. Sorry
@Joericono Pretty good trick huh!?
@MichaelSmartGuy @sam_reginald i used my personal phone and this is my work phone in the pic
@ErectionHaver Maybe next time
@ALessAngryScot they’re really light colored
@sean516 Won’t be the last time!
@FredrikSouther Two arms
@Joericono Read the tweet you’re replying to
@MarvintheTorch Besides the cool background of course
@hmans Your answer was too late

@2tonbug Yes. Let me see what i have
@3nickromero3 Thanks
@Keyvon212 Thanks
@robertisnthere Thanks

@kimcaramele Sorry
@JulianHoeber Yeah you used a 2nd phone
@elevatyler Try it on your friends
@DestiGeddon sorry to disappoint you by doing the reveal a half hour early
@cup4water This was fun. Might do more puzzles in the future
@raymondedwards nice job!
Ok I’m answering this a little early (8:30 pacific) because now is when i have time. None of you got it right. The phone in the picture is a work phone and i used a 2nd phone (my personal phone) to take the picture.
@yellow_vincent Not sure
@Old_Marley Probably
@geiger78395690 prepare to be converted at 9 pacific tonight
@leahblizz That would be good. wish i thought of that
@osamabinlobbin Wow. Thank you
@osamabinlobbin Did Tobias do this trick? Jk you’re saying i look like him
@PrototypeCube not to me
@Dingo_Kayfabe I’ll have some one tell you in the morning
@DIY_skeleton I know
@WeinerBarf420 that’s pretty vague
@bob_crosley Good idea. Mind if i use it some time?
@LankyTurtle Not sure
@dQcQb Im not that good
@TheodoreGoose Photoshop is for taking things out of a pic
@JulianHoeber My way was the trickier one probably
@jessiedotjs camera app not up
@LoQe But the camera app isn’t up
@GhettoArmy find out at 9 pacific
@comer310 @LB_Denberg Take a quick nap before
@ThePirhana11 9 pacific. Tune in to find out
@DanMentos Good luck
@JulianHoeber don’t tell how we do it til after 9 pacific
@sammcmorris 9 pacific!
@LydiaBurrell You would love it if that were the case wouldnt you?
@swarm_trans Wouldn’t be a selfie then
@josiahhughes Maybe..find out at 9 pacific
@AFC_Cameron @fart That would t be a “selfi”
@bobo_circus Find out at 9 pacific
@fart Jon you’re not alone in this sentiment
@ninetek Would that still be considered a selfie ?
@MichaelSmartGuy @sam_reginald More than an idea. I’m positive it’s 12 am
@sam_reginald @MichaelSmartGuy 11 i think
@CrampyRatPoison find out at 9 pacific
@bc00l_ you are correct that it is a “trick”
@MichaelSmartGuy @sam_reginald maybe sleep a couple hours before then get up for the announcement
@brunch_dump i like where your minds at but how did the phone end up in my hand in the photo?
@tim_oyler wow remember those? would be a good trick
@GnarlyWhitehur1 Good guess!
@DomCarterAgain It’s ok
@DomCarterAgain Wouldn’t you like to know
@OgachekoOmale find out at 9 pacific if you are correct though i doubt it
@sam_reginald @MichaelSmartGuy you and your analysts are correct...again
@2tonbug i probably do one one of those but probably didn’t screen screen it. We’ll see..at 9 pacific
@MichaelSmartGuy Hmm not sure. Maybe @sam_reginald ?
@pedrorossob 9 pacific. That is when I’ll have time to do it
@RoverSuede If it’s a selfie there can only be one phone. The phone of the person taking their own picture
@MichaelSmartGuy popular answer that you can find out is incorrect at 9 pacific
@MetalGearEric find out at 9 pacific if you’re right
@human_millipede kinda like the throwing a baseball around the world trick
@pucksandpints love those things but no
@pwnzzynick Check back at 9 pacific to see how your answer fared
@jordiesaenz You got it
@futurewah Check back at 9 pacific to see how you did
@bombbiggity You can tell her
@lordbeef done
@_mikemontoya wow what  an honor !
a lot of good guesses. at 9:00 pacific I’ll reveal how it was done. stay up east coasters
@PornUniversity Big reveal tonight at 9 pacific
@seinfeldbig nope. But might incorporate into a future “puzzle”
@modernistbird might do that one for my next “puzzle”
@awhailnaw thought people needed a little bit of fun
@rwoodsmall can’t see this reply. I’m guessing it’s incorrect though
@PornUniversity Hint: its a trick
@lordbeef that’d be too easy
@CptBaker close
@pharmasean Yes i can
@benbrouckaert getting warmer
@coolmomsean too easy
@Cryptoterra rules is rules
@Mister_Veritas I bet it’ll come to you in a few days
@WoodFeels He has done that before but this one as i said is a selfie
@Cryptoterra ah bring them back
@jordiesaenz a little more complex than that
@CptBaker how are they arranged?
@danjan13 maybe..
@Cryptoterra now that’s a fun answer
here’s a puzzle for you guys to figure out. This photo is a selfie. yet I’m holding my phone in the photo. how? good luck https://t.co/Sj1iNtA8RD
@McKnightVision Does doing work count?
@thegr0ceryst0re That sounds fake
@DothTheDoth not gonna sugar coat it
@DothTheDoth i ate it
@hezicka you bet it does
@blood_orphan going to a new grocery store [first drake orange parka pic]
different grocery stores have different items on different aisles https://t.co/Cykcqdgsz8
@jinpaynus VPs have no power really though
@MichaelSmartGuy i have those i just keep coming back to also
@MichaelSmartGuy Then your list is complete
@MichaelSmartGuy you should do new mexico too
@erik_normal that’s a lot of extra time that’s unnecessary
@Sean_GMC @gourmetspud Enjoy
(watching garbage men take my garbage) oh well. didn’t really want any of that stuff anyway. all my best stuff is here inside
@breeeemer an extra window seat
@oldfriend99 thought they’d be able to tell which is which by how old the garbage is but i think you’re right. better label it
@sammyjacobs you got it
going to be out of town next week so wheeled next week’s garbage to the curb as well
@murder_is_legal lucky bastard
@sarahashsummer shark but only by a little
can’t have your cake and eat it too https://t.co/0fsauv0rLv
@dumfuqk Hope it’s good. No return without the receipt
@Chase_Observes Hard to believe i actually did film it really
@DanMentos always do
@Tommytoughstuff nope
@sarahashsummer probably nothing
@TheQuonter will do
worth a try https://t.co/2TRjv4spfs
i don’t know dude looks to me like you’ve got more to worry about than just that https://t.co/gCaV6tKqPb
i told them this show was a bad idea https://t.co/KXe2X5tucY
@gf3 yeah I’d be freaked out if i was a doctor and this guy walked into my office
@AlbertDesu i guess he could
@oldfriend99 : A good prank would be to hand someone a can of pop upside-down. When they open it, it will spill all over their legs 😂🤣
@lunch_enjoyer : watching tv with my two sons https://t.co/A3Q5aLePKq
@WeinerBarf420 no
@wrightontarget I guess you’re right
@NoGodsNoGamers That’d be something
@Gene_Kreemer I think it means every tv show and movie not a show or movie called Everything
@NoGodsNoGamers watching Herman’s head right now
@bumbledumbledee How was it?
wow well that should spell the end for all the other streaming services then https://t.co/kmiZjcBX6u
@CorndogNinja That guy looks maybe 80?
@AlbertDesu yep that’s the guy
@AlbertDesu yeah they say that in the movie
sorry but all I’m saying is i just don’t think it’s a coincidence that there’s a magic mask that turns you into a cartoon character and the person who finds it just happens to be the best physical comedy actor of the time
@rhymeswithstan im in awe of it
@jinpaynus here’s what these famous scenes looked like before they started filming them
@ItsPhetz I’d be interested in seeing what that looks like
some people saying this *is* before the special effects. well then i want to see what it looked like before that
@unluckyalvarado this is my famous character “dumb guy” saying this
@BreadOwO1 Sorry
@McKnightVision then I’d like to see what it looked like before that
@eersfansmf @tejanoheat wonder what this looked like before special effects
@tejanoheat I’d be interested to see how they made the guy look green
im interested to see what this one looked like before special effects https://t.co/86nFmOK9rS
@erik_normal Not frozen with ice just stuck in that position forever
@dumbmongreldog yeah
@DrGhostbaby would love to see them
(patting my pockets) my pipes! https://t.co/WcqHebbNOU
@randypriceiv hey it kinda does
@bofaconstrictor my wife is much more into TRL than html
@postholeservice I’ll let her know
@MediumIQ I’ll ask her if she likes it as well
@TexRipples I guess she might
@sarahashsummer I’ll let her know
@carlenenlmmo Thanks. Glad he sent it to me
@SwedenDC buddies always get the best pics
@macthompson Me?
@Old_Marley Thank you
@DomCarterAgain Yep!
@AlexDBolton I hope so too
@susiemmilligan Just good phone camera
@acomplexcollin Yeah. Can’t afford a drink of it these days
@acomplexcollin I think i might be too old to pull it off now. A lot changes in 5 years
@acomplexcollin Oh man i think i deleted that gas pic again. I can’t find it
@SirSandGoblin Thanks for being willing to help me
@erik_normal Thanks for being willing
@erik_normal Someone already beat you but i won’t turn down a 2nd one
@SirSandGoblin Yeah. He has an iPhone 4
@itswatertime Was hoping for the whole reply about the resolution and stuff but beggars can’t be choosers i guess... he has an iPhone 4
@twothickscoops It’s all coming full circle
@jordosbaloney Mine dont
@ghosthenrywoton Nice work
@AlbertDesu Too focused on the road
@ghosthenrywoton Where am i here?
@ShaolinGrandma He is a really good friend
@meatbod get them out on the road and it’ll start happening
@nilbog3000 Thank you
@nibiru_TRUTH made the same typo you just did when i made my Twitter handle actually
@smeIIe Wow thanks
@jimdavishouse He’s pretty good with the camera
@twothickscoops So did he. that’s why he sent it to me
my buddy just sent me this pic he got of me as he passed me going the opposite direction on the road. thought i’d share https://t.co/0JgYXdH2bd
@AlbertDesu the first one
@breeeemer yeah could get 28 days out of it if you like your water less cold
@_trevorcavanagh do the math
@JASNSNO Yep slides right into a bottle or glass. no problem
@slghtrfc 2 week freshness guarantee
@reallysmallLegs Freezer for no longer than 2 weeks
@funkopopzizek ever drink a day old glass of water on your night stand?
@jinpaynus yep. 2 weeks tops
@jordosbaloney yeah. Everything is intuitive for me
@BreadOwO1 Doubt it!
@COMAone what?
@spookperson @geiger78395690 something to consider
@murder_is_legal like my cubes a little fresher than that. Say 14 days old. tops
@murder_is_legal Seen those before
@geiger78395690 got 14 days to figure that out! Jk. I fill it back up with water
@PajamaStew It’s ice, man
@cowlickcherub what do you do with the other 12 cubes?
@stevenlee23188 it’s refillable
@riley652799 not a chance
@googleymoogley plain and simple
@murder_is_legal Because you kept it at room temperature. Only’ll last 2 days like that
@BlindBill99 @fuzzybritches thanks that’s what i said as well
@fuzzybritches Not if i keep it in the freezer
some people think using an ice cube tray this size is too big for just one person and say it’s a “waste of ice” but you don’t have to use all the ice at once. the ice will stay good in the freezer.  now ive got 14 days of ice here https://t.co/MY6cdDd0Ep
@sam_reginald had to double check just to make sure my eyes weren’t deceiving me  but i got pudding pie as well
@sam_reginald what pie did you get Sam?
@anotherluke82 I think they just asked every person born that decade over the phone
@surfduder most popular pie for the full decade
120 year old guy: very cool! https://t.co/Wd27WsxNH3
@BreadOwO1 yet they took my completely intact fish skeleton
@subjacktive @HaydenLikeHey nicest thing I’ve heard all day
@basehead You got it
@DrGhostbaby can’t think of anything right now
@itswatertime thank you hope yours is doing alright as well
@thegr0ceryst0re Yeah. Seems like it took some breaking in but it’s real nice now
@BreadOwO1 let me think about that
@BreadOwO1 Yeah got it at the shirt store a few years ago
@MoneySnatchers1 It’s not a map of town so i usually go online for that but if they get lost in the world the map helps
@CallardAbe Do i have to die for you to do that ?
@awhailnaw You should know this from my tweets alone
@TheQuonter like I’d never wear a bands shirt to their concert i was wearing this watching discovery
@DomCarterAgain i bet there are some out there
@riboflavinLLC Didn’t need it in this pic
@SPREEEEEEEEEEEE please don’t  ask for a pic of the tv
@tdtbaa Watched a show
@RomeoDesign_ Yeah i do
@HaydenLikeHey Thank you but this post is about watching tv
@riboflavinLLC they’re just regular bulbs and light the living room
@NoGodsNoGamers loved em
@jinpaynus @joan_unweek @Speediest_Sloth the big guy with a nail in his head in happy Gilmore saying “and YOU can count on me waiting for you in the parking lot” *is*just for me and my buddies
@DrGhostbaby yes i wanna feel old
@bobo_circus i better go check
every single one of them https://t.co/NxmSTarVIc
@Oreo_Poptart will do
@turdvolcano perfect day for it
if i can’t get anybody else to take my garbage to the dump during the rest of the week then at least i know the garbage men will on garbage day
@sam_reginald did they have any?
@tdtbaa maybe that’s what he’s working up to? still developing this character
thinking about a guy who has been really good about quarantine and following all covid safety precautions but slipped up once to go ride a mechanical bull for his first time. couldn’t wait any longer to try it
@sam_reginald sounds like something i might do
@sam_reginald Sam youve done it again
@ItsPhetz got em
@geiger78395690 seeing them leave with no groceries
waiting in line to get into trader joe’s with all the other grocery fans
long line into Trader Joe’s right now. must be some big name groceries in there tonight
@jordandanford Just a letter. No candy this time
@Gamplayr yeah i probably will
(having to change lanes to pass a slower vehicle) ah man i really liked that lane..
@sam_reginald sounds great
@Laser_Cat You’re welcome
@sam_reginald gonna make their days I’m sure
@respectfully_i I’ve been there before but I’m from Las Vegas
@jinpaynus my commute to work is just two long piles of gray rocks on either side the whole way
@bobby there’s one person we knows not wearing a hat
@MrChrisSult All in the letters
@human_millipede that’s ok
@danjan13 Mostly on them because they’re getting letters
@TangoWangoMango Why’d you do it then?
@washburn647 On the other side
@sweetwhisper69 Never leave home without one (stamp)
@haydenstearns I have my ways
@DomCarterAgain yeah they’re in the box
@geiger78395690 and now one lucky guy (me) is wearing two
@nibiru_TRUTH Didn’t want to touch it but I’ll go back and see
@tdtbaa yep. A hand written note from a friend
@weepinggold Thank you
well there’s one person out there we know who’s not wearing a mask https://t.co/NmJ7A1yT3Z
@BrockWorkman Ok I’ll put them in carefully
@pedrorossob Thank you
@DrGhostbaby that’s it
@NoGodsNoGamers mine is really good
here’s one i got of it from a little further out https://t.co/z8QpqGQGRp https://t.co/n9CBG1yLpc
@MichaelSmartGuy this ones a little different
of course right after the garbage men came and took my garbage from the curb i get a call from a guy asking if my garbage is still for sale
@BuckyIsotope Oh man i forgot about this kind of reply
@tdtbaa now i feel the need to sell some more cokes
@adamxii coming right up
coca cola’s subliminal messaging in the movies worked on me. i went straight out of the theater room to the snack bar, got behind the counter and started selling cokes
@tdtbaa i sure will
just made the word “gocation” it’s the opposite of a staycation
@dilk_meth if i could rearrange the alphabet...
sucks when you go get your mail and it’s all bills and not letters from your buddies
@VerefiedHusband they probably assume im going to work
@dilk_meth just the billboards for you
@dilk_meth guess I’ll stop now
@mluizzzaa i guess you’re right
@dilk_meth so I’m not supposed to be reading it?
got on a road with a “wrong way” sign. if this is the wrong way then why is there a road here
@darth_erogenous : i have george cloony’s looks, morgan freemans voice and lou gehrigs disease
@prophethusband would love to see a pic of them with their little boy
@scottswanson_ sure
put my coat over the urinal next to me to save it for my buddy who’s on his way
@neonwario : (Texting my biologist) What’s new in the animal kingdom
@Doctor_Sound Saving it for 2021
damn how old these brothers? 😝 https://t.co/VZzA7mgIoy
@NoGodsNoGamers The first one
@bb_teeth I did them all
a lot of americans celebrating 4th of july but not me. I’ve always been a “5th of july guy”
@bnwllms there it is
@KewlBene Thank you sir you win the internet today!
@DomCarterAgain Thanks
@stevenlee23188 3 years later
@Cals_Calzones Didn’t realize so many people were actually waiting on this
@ShaolinGrandma probably not
@WoodFeels Will do. No more left turns for me
@spookiyu Sold it
@SirSandGoblin Pretty routine
@lordbeef this is slicks wife. He survived
@bigjackash It’s nothing really
@tdtbaa I never go straight
@VerefiedHusband Took the pic on his iPhone 4s
they got that lady
me sitting on the couch between two buddies watching burn notice https://t.co/TbNNYZDOIM
@gltph relatable isn’t it
@CharlieVindaloo sounds like it
@xMancerNecro Doubt it
@colinoscopies sure are
@snppls course. gotta see that turn
@robertisnthere can’t remember. what were we all eating in 2017?
@Paulsdumb i did a tweet about that once
@LeonardEctric1 have “big day” written on my calendar
@tim_oyler my favorite one I’ve had
@WeinerBarf420 hadn’t noticed
@gltph guess the guy can’t really say no
Canada day or as they call it in Canada:  “day”
@UnwinderH Nope
@or_vice_versace What did we do without it!
in honor of the 10th anniversary of the sun https://t.co/JlNd1hVszD
@Joericono catch up on the past 10 years they missed
@stuhutch2 great entry point
@VerefiedHusband Like me
@pharmasean me either. I’ll where sunglasses now
@danchovy you always were a sucker for the sun
@hedoobie Google it
must see for anyone familiar with The Sun https://t.co/7jfHMmvrPu
@Bingbong_TM only the three best guys
@VerefiedHusband yep
10 years ago we had bob hope, johnny cash, and steve jobs but we blew it
@conor_tripler dude I’m 39 years old.. so all of them
10 years ago we had bob hope, johnny cash, and steve jobs. they were best friends, they roomed together, they married 3 sisters, triplets. now they’re gone
@sarahashsummer very nicely
@blood_orphan guess it’s come to that
@poko_hahaha You know how some of these guys are
@Auroen_Isvara Thank you
@OwnenP sounds cool
@PlumDunker Thanks
@onmids looks like a good one
@McKnightVision give it a go i guess
@sam_reginald Playin it like a fiddle
@Gamplayr Hmm kinda does
@heavy___hearts Looks like you’re giving it a go
@Trill_shitman feelin good
@SmellTheBook Big cat
@VlCTOR___ Heh heh. I guess so
@trollabelle So far so good
@WeinerBarf420 Been doing that for years
@tdtbaa That’s all I’ve been doing so far
@jiyahkelly heh heh. guess so
trying out having a cat https://t.co/HGkSVj2Dlp
@ramseycarr Definitely a defining feature
@alileeming Nope. Guess until you get it right
@BlueSpacey Jk it’s my house
@BlueSpacey She looked like she was having fun
@BlueSpacey i wish!
@CandyBreaker @searlo54 10
@ninetek Tan lady
@melip0ne @PorkTartare where?
@craigrachel hopping in my car now
@foucault_45 More of a “feels like” number
@husbandsrevenge already guessed that in the 10 min
@McLeemz @MichaelSmartGuy pretty narrowed down at that point
@GraceSpelman hard not to
@MichaelSmartGuy that’s why she’s the champ
@Med_Down she was very tan
@searlo54 there was a lot of “um” time in the 20 min
@caine_colette yes
@TweetsfromBAR @VerefiedHusband nope
@ggooooddddoogg real tan
@leyawn she shouldn’t be doing that to me
@kolacey I guessed Andrea Martin which was wrong
@VerefiedHusband I wasn’t. I guessed our neighbor “Bev” like 4 times
today my wife said “guess who i saw in costco today?” then made me guess for like 10 min and when i didnt guess it was like “remember that super tan lady we saw walking down the street last week..” thats who she thought i might guess. a lady we dont even know that we saw one time
@TankertonLatch it’s hot
https://t.co/BUpAVoFNVj
@jodiecook big mistake
@jeffwalkersdead because 😈
@BuckyIsotope I’d watch it again
@ItsPhetz don’t want to waste it while everyone is sleeping
@yurpty That’s right
@YaoMingsCock Stopped paying attention
stayed up so late last night with my buddies that all the tv channels stopped playing shows thinking everyone would be asleep
@denverbros I guess they didn’t play for that long but i watched them that long
@McKnightlight yep
@Wonderfull_TIm Ok will do
@danchovy the chay
@danchovy Not getting enough takers. No go on the pic for now
@meatbod Yeah i think so
@sweetwhisper69 @hahahhhahahaa I guess that’s true
@hahahhhahahaa wait wait it’s actually my wife
@trashgodclaire I’ve been known to
@jinpaynus Now im imagining getting canceled for this even when people know it’s actually my wife
@bigjackash Now that’s what i like to hear
@AlbertDesu Hoping she doesnt see me actually
@rudetanks Seinfeld makes any tv look good  💅
telling my friend i really like his new tv because im enjoying the show that’s on
@surfduder Ok
turning on my tv to see if there’s any tv on to watch
@rwoodsmall Ope...haha
@jinpaynus It’s too dim. Adds nothing in the day
@jaywking yep
@GayRodney If i have to!
@MichaelSmartGuy yeah I’m a classics guy
@DocBrackenreed Im not
@michael_raphone got to go right when they put em on the rollers
@jaggings So I’ll know if  i dont like it right away?
@husbandsrevenge Feels like i already did with this post!
@michael_raphone if you say so mike
@jinpaynus I’ll make myself at home
@jadabetaboo Good thing you had that week
@danchovy I get it. There are a lot of people there
garbage day is only once a week so you have a full week with your garbage to decide if you really want to get rid of it
@surfduder hey they’re just doing their job
@dannyzyall the dump
wheeling my garbage out to the curb. wouldn’t be surprised if the garbage men come get it. they just can’t help themselves
@BuckyIsotope I’ll pick up a treat while im there
@Gary4z The michael jordan of gas
@jchristopher1 Never do
@AlbertDesu Id prefer the gas
@ravierson girl gas
@TheHoshuah That would be weird
@siberianpine Nos
@anxiousbeefcake that’s sauce
@dilk_meth Don’t see why not
@rwoodsmall I hope you’re right
@corporateguac sounds like it’s meant for a diesel
@clockworkgarnet Thanks i will
alright twitter going to buy my first tank of gas any suggestions
@Jackson75700219 Do it every time i drive
@Black_Rock_Dave Keeping it in the air
@ill_munchkin @Gamplayr something tells me he won’t care
passenger side airbag not working https://t.co/jroOVGm1VJ
@el_caligulo Don’t look in Alaska anymore
@Gamplayr Need those few mins
@dannyjenkem hmmm
@TheQuonter Ok. I won’t
@ItsPhetz a lot to do before you get out. Might as well get what i can done early
taking my seatbelt off about 15 minutes away from my destination to “get ready to get out of the car”
@WoodFeels just get it out of that unsafe state
@lunch_enjoyer not sure. i didn’t follow up with mine
@lunch_enjoyer at 20k followers you’ll get a letter in the mail from the city requesting you come
@branvoyage Yeah it’s brought up pretty early in the first episode and don’t think it lets up from there
@utonomous That’s it. Thanks. Hoping the full article is linked in there as well
@JacobOller : This is the hardest I've ever known someone didn't watch the thing they were writing about https://t.co/0tAHfx9rj8
@SorryMomDotGov I know. Tell that to the article guy
@TheRealMoonyMan Im pretty sure it was real
ive been rewatching king of the hill and now im thinking about that guy who wrote an article about the show and said the show never tells you what hank hill does for work
@Benkly17 good question
@VlCTOR___ Damn. Didn’t catch that part
@brogadishu founding fathers knew
this on top of everything else we’re already dealing with https://t.co/7cs216jEbb
@Senatorbobadams shit’s nasty!
@jinpaynus Waste of their time
(wheeling in garbage can from the road after garbage men came) damn they took ALL OF IT
@brickmoranis cans still there
@JorbisHamput Is it really?
@TheElZilcho well I’ll put most of it back out next week then
garbage men came and got my garbage this morning. hope i don’t see any of that stuff for a long time
@samelpan @coolp1np What a nice mom
something wrong with society when cars’ back windows only ever say “wash me” and never say “drive me”
to be eligible the movie now has to be good https://t.co/D5DVqOmeWq
asking someone for the best way to  get to the destination im driving to then after their answer responding with “I’ll check it out” like im being recommended music or a movie I’ll probably never listen to or watch
@slursayer Makes sense
@WeinerBarf420 Haves and have nots
@danchovy It sure is
(to buddy leaving on a birding trip) see a bird for me
@sarahashsummer Then drag them all along behind you
@TamingMyImpala then maybe bring one more
@sarahashsummer this isn’t the cars movie. This is real life
@RickVonJaeger then you’d take that one originally
@RickVonJaeger Then you’d probably use the one you’re driving right?
hey man you don't have to take all your cars everywhere you go. you can just drive one and leave the rest at home https://t.co/2biTihNpt6
@scottswanson_ I’m not gonna look at it
@legokillermoth experts don’t want you to see how skinny he is
@jinpaynus gotta wear those eclipse glasses when seeing it
experts wouldn’t wish seeing it on their worst enemy. It’s just too rare https://t.co/PGvD0x3VaL
@sarahashsummer Not doing foul balls yet
major league baseball has made the decision to slowly begin the baseball season starting with just the home runs
@MichaelSmartGuy That’s one of things that’ll probably never come back post-virus
@Tommytoughstuff That’s a type of homer man cmon
@AryehCW sure feels like it
@jinpaynus We’re all hoping i get 8
@oldfriend99 Thanks. All the right elements are there for it to happen
going to sleep. not trying to break any records or anything tonight. just hoping for a good 7-8 hours
@danchovy history
@UnwinderH Can’t really blame him

@nicobetancur_ it was
@brogadishu none of that sheen looked off of them
@gcm116 get in line
sucks when you’re out bird watching and when you finally find the bird you can tell it’s already been seen before
@scottswanson_ Nope
@scottswanson_ My buddy jared
@kpducc Rare one
out bird watching with some other birders taking turns looking at the bird. I’m up next

@jazzgoodings with no stops they would be
saw that rocket launch earlier. looked like it was headed to space
@acomplexcollin ill try to shoot off a few more for you at some point
yeah i saw those two guys in spacesuits you’re asking about probably not more than three hours ago. from the looks of the direction they were headed in i would guess they were headed to space
no reason the spacex launch shouldn’t happen today. it’s saturday so the astronauts have the day off of work
@melip0ne I’ve never been
too bad. he’d love it there https://t.co/v293Cx0hOG
the astronauts couldn’t get work off https://t.co/jbXREeNyEw

@ItsPhetz Not for me. I’m really bad at photoshop
@charlotteryanm the grand canyon
@lunch_enjoyer most cord hats are too tall looking on my head. Yours looks really nice on your head though
@Johnyoung88 They’re good
@lunch_enjoyer nice. I’m always looking for the perfect corduroy hat
@lunch_enjoyer can i see that hat better?
@dereknason let’s grow some tomatoes down there
@hezicka Feel free to zoom in on it
@DazMcQ yep it’s a pretty good example of one
@sam_reginald might put it on my list as well
@kpducc you’d be surprised
@elmstep Thanks it’s from men’s warehouse
@buttbuglar Would be nice to be able to see the whole thing in one look

@whoisnatebailey arizona
@FunnyTerro We should go
@PajamaStew Me
@markhoppus even though the movie as a whole was predictable and not super scary, to me it’s in The Visit when the grandma is running on all fours underneath the house
@risky_pringle I wouldn’t know 😉
was having so much fun hanging out with my birding group on our bird watching trip that i forgot to see the bird
fighting with my other bird watching buddies about “who gets to see the bird”
@BrandonElzby @tastefactory You think so?
@tastefactory Thanks pat

@milkdeath1 hard not to!
@milkdeath1 What do you see?
@BassoonJokes Hope it’s not mine. I’m not home!
@UnwinderH Nice callback

@NotUrplePingo yeah i can’t believe how often I’m right
@npelosi1 Never been
@NotUrplePingo https://t.co/aYEtyO5z83 https://t.co/Rx4BZMILWG

@nilbog3000 not sure
@CharlieVindaloo i guess i could
@serious_adult @jaggings @GayRodney A lady in Spain once asked me what the weather is like in the United States
@CharlieVindaloo for what?
@jaggings @GayRodney just meet me in new york
@GayRodney send 𝙎𝙃𝙐𝙏 𝘿𝘼 𝙁𝙐𝘾𝙆 𝙐𝙋 link
@GayRodney You do need to give me additional details but only because Central Park is so small i can’t even see it
@nilbog3000 i think he seems alright
@nilbog3000 Which one?
@DomCarterAgain Thanks dom
@clint_bing can’t remember the name
@thismandumb That’s pretty recent to see something like this though
@JimmyJazz1968 if you find out let me know
@tdtbaa true. hope they have fun

@adamxii take your time
coworker: (pretending to be looking at the upcoming weekend through binoculars) is it just me or does this coming weekend look a little long...

@KevCantHang He looks good
my wife’s downstairs watching sister act but i didn’t want to watch it so i went upstairs to our room and im watching sister act 2
@AlbertDesu They just closed
@WeinerBarf420 Fingers crossed
@wwwdotdeath Ok
@TheElZilcho Luckily most of it seems to be on the inside most of the time
@somewaterplz no way dude
@TheWillieCoxJr not bad
@sam_reginald he loved it so much he once said “its one of my favorite sports”
michael jordan won 6 nba championships and proved to the world that basketball was his favorite sport
me: how’s it look?
garbage man (quickly looks through my garbage): yep. I dont know anybody who wouldnt get rid of what you have here. good work this week
great choice. those are the two episodes i would’ve concluded it with as well https://t.co/0eOSSBd8iJ
@bigjackash Just my belief
@VerefiedHusband Was bound to happen
@VerefiedHusband instead of just beating the old record by a day
@70Ceeks Oh brother
@g0ldfarb 8
@BentzICT ha. Yeah
water is so stupid, man. it just goes and falls right off the cliff lol https://t.co/iJnqEd0w7F
@ub3rlegen Good shot at worlds tallest twins though
@hotcraig46 i cant
@JLSLFK Guinness book of world records
@sam_reginald @danchovy what an honor that would be
@danchovy @sam_reginald only god has it
@sam_reginald Not so far i can’t
@sam_reginald yeah i wouldn’t complain were it to end
@sam_reginald Oh you know me I’m just doing my thing..how are you?
@BentzICT very watchable bird
@somecleverthing writing this down
@jeffrauw What a beaut
@g0ldfarb was out of place with the bird ones. Maybe tomorrow
@chaindaddy69 Yep
@jinpaynus might seemlessly switch back and forth
@CharlieVindaloo not sure. Hard to see who’s driving what car
@RichardoDad yes. All my bird watching tweets are for them as well
@CptBaker that’s what the call a “tell”
every serious bird watcher will never forget the first time they saw a bird
@RealRedRoss a classic bird
(out bird watching with other bird watchers and sees a bird) this is why we do this
@_GuyIncognito__ That’s why we do it
@Flynah you’re welcome. Didn’t get a response from you in the first. That’s how i knew something wasn’t right
@SirSandGoblin Let me know if you read how long it was
@SirSandGoblin youll have to ask the guys timing it
@_zazzles_ those ones are cool
Here on the left you have a specific type of bird: the bald eagle. and on the right you have just a bird https://t.co/R9fOG2CTyG
placard for these two guys says 
Species: fish
Region of the world: the water https://t.co/DPDJK7VPgR
when you look at the aquarium placard for this guy it just says "fish" https://t.co/bhhvcErufy
there definitely are many different specific types of birds and fish but also there are some that are just called “bird” and “fish” with no other more specific name
@DomCarterAgain Yep
@drankturpentine there definitely are different types of birds but also birds that are just named “bird”
@dioerasabbath Woulda worked on me
@Ygrene depends on when the show was made actually
@ItsPhetz give you a taste for shows so you’ll go buy some more
@WeinerBarf420 My money is on yes
i love my new tv i just got. it has really great tv shows
@npelosi1 that’s memes for ya
@shmuel_yln It’s ok
I would actually prefer it if there were no other cars on the road while I'm driving. The other cars don't do anything for me
@sam_reginald Reporting for duty
jeff bezos is about to become the first trillionaire while there are still people out there who don’t even have a billion
@ewewewt Sure why not
@pucksandpints Pee in the urinal. Poop in the stall
@pucksandpints Imagine that’s what he was pouring it from
@turdvolcano the big one
scientist slowly pours a beaker of pee into a beaker of poop and it explodes
@erik_normal 1998 Honda Accord
@jakerummel thanks. I would love to get down still though
@jakerummel Put it back up for you
@npelosi1 it’s a big tree

@jakerummel I got out of the tree. Jk. Maybe I’ll do it again for you
@danchovy that’s what Calvin wants. you’re letting him win

@BassoonJokes i didn’t name the thing
@BassoonJokes actually ace Ventura is the pet detective
@Digby_Taylor there is
@OwnenP Anybody’s guess
astronauts to be launched into space with mission to “check it out”
@ItsPhetz Clearing some space
@maybemimiiii That’s what he came to NASA with an they agreed to send him
@CharlieVindaloo oh man
@relfy99 my friend got this pic of me when he was passing me going the other way in his car
@sarahlindish bound to happen when people start making points
@sarahlindish great point
@brogadishu Yep. I’m going to be shaking my head and mumbling “well maybe if you did your commute once every two weeks to stay sharp...” under my breath the whole way
@WeinerBarf420 Yeah
girlfriend: may the 4th be with you 
me: (feelings for her just arent quite there yet to where I could say it back &amp; really mean it) thanks
me, a limo driver dropping someone off: hope the car was long enough for you. have a nice night
@tim_oyler I’ve had some practice yes
@jinpaynus probably will sleep then get right on them in the morning
@CharlieVindaloo I could really use the RT from her though
@jinpaynus probably get that one in the rear view about 5
@TheHyyyype Me too
@RadishHarmers Nice to get a little break
absolutely plowing through my meals today. had 2 of 3 done by 11:30
@WeinerBarf420 I’m not hungry right after lunch
@WeinerBarf420 It’s 11:45 am here
@gravmyrt could be either or because his scalped could get sunburned
@squirelTouchdwn @plunderphunk Switch r+7 and replica and change the = to a &gt; and it works for me
@plunderphunk It’s alright. But it is a harder type of album to have a favorite for me. Definitely think of it as a whole
@plunderphunk But maybe Up
@haramcart ope haha
@plunderphunk Probably power of persuasion
@kpducc Is it?
@rudetanks yep
@rudetanks https://t.co/OZQl1jeqyF
@TimKania Tehehehe
@TimKania https://t.co/MqXzVaY46F
it’s funny they call them “unidentified flying objects”. I could identify them right away. those are ufos
@boudreau_paul Pretty nice
@xMancerNecro nope
@serious_adult They do love to joke over there
@denverbros sometimes they replay stuff like the next week
@milkdeath1 Two weeks I’ll be hitting it hard
@nilbog3000 That’s right

@DrGhostbaby exactly. Don’t risk having to miss a day of work
@Doctor_Sound Yeah on Facebook and Instagram
@couchdweller give it a call if you’d like
@couchdweller I kinda like the one 2 in there
@maybemimiiii yeah I was pretty on the money this morning but then thought “wait until we got real traffic out here”
@Robeitussin Ah i see. I’d say see if the subway will let you go by yourself
@milkdeath1 Yep. Just one little thing I’m still working on fixing
@Robeitussin You don’t have to get out of your car
@buttbuglar In case you pass your buddy going the opposite direction and he gets a pic of you
@robertisnthere That’s why it’s recommended
@Robeitussin if you wanna risk being a little rusty on your first commute back be my guest
@shmuel_yln same to you my friend
@MillerBombz i love it
@MillerBombz listening to a little thing called music
current recommendation if you are working from home now is to still do your commute once every two weeks to stay “sharp” https://t.co/aqy5N8An20
@goddamn_genius homer would drink em i bet
@ItsPhetz have fun!
it’s one of my beliefs that if a woman wearing a hat outside sees a bald man without a hat she should offer him her hat like a man should offer a woman his jacket when it’s cold
@TankertonLatch Doubt it

@jogvlen important
@abadassskull that’s me!
@bastardghost golf
@modernistbird cool
@glittersquirrel didn’t expect a tennis deep cut like this until way later
can we get a thread going of sports terms and slang? I’ll start: 
home plate
@bestsoupintown I’ve heard about that
@rudetanks @70Ceeks How about a “deep shot, just foul”
@70Ceeks @rudetanks Off the wall double
@rudetanks @70Ceeks What about a leap n leaner?
@rudetanks @70Ceeks Missing “plays at the plate”
@snacksident When he campin in the key &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;
@70Ceeks @rudetanks the 1-2 pitch
@jinpaynus 👀 the refs
@rudetanks Not to me
@SardonicDroll No dice
@milkdeath1 Not even a dude throwing a 100 mile an hour heater ?
@StrasiTunity @ItsPhetz nobody “going yard”
@ItsPhetz exsqueeze me
some mlb fans are just realizing that no baseball means no home runs
@awhailnaw for sure
@kdonnn better than trying to run to my room without saying anything but he knew something was up
@SamsungShawty think so
@prophethusband when you open your presents at your party later let us know what you got
for the first time in history a barrel of oil costs less than a drink of stream water using your hands as a cup
@kpducc everything must go
@DingoHilgard Sha think
@jinpaynus Sha think
@adamxii that makes a lot more sense
@g0ldfarb I’ve heard people talk about it
@tublunts i was thinking about putting it in a car
@pharmasean never heard of it
alright well at that price i might have to finally go get some. See what all the hubbub’s about https://t.co/KBEqEwePE6
@BassoonJokes i kind of doubt it
@kpducc that’s our boy
@IllyBocean i think i could take him if i got higher cards than him
sure michael jordan was very good at basketball but how good is he at the card game "war": the game of pure luck where the highest card wins
@Braingetter : MUST SEE: Tragic Video Captures Piano Falling On Cat. WATCH TILL THE END!!! https://t.co/35TrysCde5
@gloomfather : What I've been missing most these days is just hooting and hollering with the boys in the saloon and then immediately becoming eerily silent every time anyone walks through the door
@ZackKunzler pretty crazy
@breeeemer i do
@evomek yeah that battery is pretty good
@evomek thought i did
Youre a sucker if you don’t have this one lined up for the right time in your drafts https://t.co/geUJu9RfqP
@scawn_ happy bday, buddy
@beeritocat @whorevidal of course. you don’t have to meet them all
@danchovy Ahooga
your mission should you choose to accept it.. https://t.co/4bI086ayjQ
@LordFinster Have you ever done on e of these before
got to the 6th dot and figured out what this is. not gonna finish it https://t.co/SseS1XBdNc
@rad_milk guess I’ll have to connect the dots
@BaalAzabab because one gotta go
@TimKania @Kyle1092 sorry. No
@evilxbeat Give it a good home
@lightning__dolt that’s why keyboard gotta stay
@lordbeef @BigJB21_ that’s why nobody has said “keyboard gotta go” yet
@breeeemer That’s the popular pick so far
@neonsinatra hard to do much without that block
@BrockWorkman so you going with monitor?
@ErectionHaver bet you’d rather have the monitor though
@BigJB21_ yeah
@rubblebobble bet you’d prefer not to do that though
@BigJB21_ Without it what you doing with the other 3!
one gotta go https://t.co/SJly58FlEi
@YowleeGonzaro depends where you live
@hippieswordfish do they? I’ve wondered
@lunch_enjoyer was this like 2 years ago?
@brogadishu lotta ball left to be played
@brogadishu any dingers?
@VerefiedHusband as long as they at least give me a lil break from it
@therealBCF me either. It’s nasty
garbage men came and got my garbage. glad they did. the stuff’s nasty
@zedogica it’s not
@dannyzyall i just crapped one out i swear i swallowed 6 years ago
@phonegu86849968 yours a bad rope or something?
@phonegu86849968 Just eyeballed it. Nothing official
@Robeitussin not me
@Robeitussin from a rope?
@TheQuonter me too
@efanekoku89 no it’s a rope
@trharris96 Rope
@clint_bing No. There’s a pandemic going on
a lot of people  talking about how sick they are of being quarantined.. well it beats just sitting at home all day!
@cooljinzo @rudetanks woulda been a pretty fun flight
@rudetanks we crashed
@rudetanks i was on that flight into the lady’s vagina
@xMancerNecro you familiar with craig? They’re doing a lot of construction. So not great
@markedly gotta keep things as close to my normal commute as possible! Thanks!
@sammyjacobs Hey thanks sorry i missed this earlier
@mrfuggin Yeah we are
@wpgphotog Oh thanks i guess they are
@mrfuggin Any true friend would do that for you really
@SeanBIFF as they say: no skips!
@jodiecook I’ll win you back next time
@CptBaker that was probably the only one that was unquestionably on the list
@jodiecook What other ones?
@ItsPhetz Sounds like you’d lose your own head if it wasn’t attached
@dereknason Born there
@ub3rlegen Gotta keep that up too
@milkdeath1 yeah I’ll get there
@lordbeef hit up Craig damn near daily
@milkdeath1 a few kinks to work out but pretty good
@dylliewillie Gotta take the road a little ways
that’s fine that people are now baking bread during quarantine i guess but a lot of us have been doing that for quite awhile haha (it’s later revealed that i thought baking bread meant toasting it in the toaster)
@emmaaconway greatest words
@ptrevre prap
@slapdunk not if that’s where you’re going
@emmaaconway doin pretty good
@pls_b_nice_2_me @sluttyseagull guit

@kdonnn That might be a little too far
@jinpaynus Yep His true friends us guys who’ve seen the movie a few times
@brogadishu ET....my man
@balltegeez Thanks
@mamennenga I sure hope not
@ablesayname A fair amount
@lightning__dolt Thanks
@human_millipede what a relief
@Old_Marley not at all
@HunterChap They’re really nice
@HunterChap They are lululemon
@MissesMeow Oh those are Birkenstock londons
@MissesMeow What are what?
@GnarlyWhitehur1 thanks but this post is about the pee
@DomCarterAgain Gotta thank “Lady Luck”
@MrGoodally I guess so!
@declanoooo pretty sick
@Senatorbobadams eventually did hit pant
@UnwinderH pretty cool right
@figgled hit pant
peed in my pants a little but it didn’t hit pant until near the bottom https://t.co/pjoDeFFGFu
@Bergertron5000 I like that
@occsionllysubtl yeah she doesn’t trust me to not get coronavirus
@Bergertron5000 does for me. she hates it
@_flyentologist once I’ve done the bit i can’t add to the list. sorry
whenever my wife asks what i want from costco a bit i like to do is send her this at the end after my list every time https://t.co/Futkcs4FL2
@PajamaStew Thanks
@mainframegrmln Yeah i hope you can do it
@WeinerBarf420 ah thanks
@WeinerBarf420 you think i have the answer?
https://t.co/De1miPYBk4
@holly_mahan honestly i can’t tell if anyone even lives in most of these places
@GnarlyWhitehur1 would be interesting
@Lego_ojsimpson He’s too good for that to happen
imagine if we lived in a world where instead of bernie sanders dropping out of the presidential race he was dropping in to a half pipe
@jodiecook thanks for coming
@adamxii The having to add another night there
@adamxii Yeah i think a lot of people were
sorry not gonna do this just because a celebrity said to https://t.co/1Wn4GSpiZ2
@fuzzybritches shit’s so nasty
@fuzzybritches yeah the stuff’s gross
@ohmyskeet Love doing that one
@dylanwarrick69 they want to get them off their hands because they’re gross
@carashortstout @zedd_wordd Just like i thought
@JohnLikeAToilet Is that good?
@BrandonElzby One for the ages
@awhailnaw thanks for thinking about it
@dylanwarrick69 That true?
@turbo_douche no problem. hope you guys find time to do some of them in the near future
@SirSwish6 What do they taste like? What’s their best comp?
@AryehCW Thank you
@magneticksara they’re no cow tail that’s for sure
@kidamnesiack Someone said they’re good
@kidamnesiack go give it a shot
@gojarbe Hard to do with this coronavirus deal
@coolguyzone Whenever i feel like i miss being a teen i think i just miss doing this specific bit
if you get some time feel free to read about this bit my brother and i used to do https://t.co/8HJmOl6XLj
@_flyentologist me too
@human_millipede It exists now but i doubt it did before this song
@Inanity101 would you like whatever he’s smoking?
@148Rk pretty crazy thing to do
@Arr Yeah i didn’t know until i recently read the lyrics
the dude jumps back in the bath right after getting out and drying off https://t.co/QwfZBRLdsk
@jinpaynus Yeah i think people can get into  “fantastical” songs like that though
@VerefiedHusband hard for me to relate to the splashing as an adult
the craziest concept for a song i think that was successfully made into a hit has to be a song about an adult man splashing in the bath on a saturday night
@BuckyIsotope @PorkTartare That might be too dangerous
@PorkTartare True could do the left turn
@brogadishu devil on my shoulder
@robertm0rgan @cakemittens Little faded but hey that happens
@_joechai thanks. They can’t hear me very well
@robertm0rgan @cakemittens https://t.co/0NAv1So3V9

@jodiecook tonight
@Old_Marley Ill let you know in a few days when I’m done
@washburn647 Not finished with it
@Yedois Felt like a good place to stop
@kpducc i am
@austin_matheson Helluva bit
@spookperson @jinpaynus Thanks. I’m asleep
@jordosbaloney Should be done with it by the end of the week
@WeinerBarf420 Feels like it is sometimes !
a bit I’d like to put into a tv show or movie would be a scene with the main guy in bed reading Goodnight Moon and he puts a bookmark in it to pick up where he left off tomorrow
@Laser_Cat I dont think so
@Laser_Cat Yeah watch it
@BenMCMLXXVII definitely accepting poops the same size at least
@PBfromCT Bet youre beating yourself up now
@brogadishu now with a moratorium on utility service disconnections we look stupid on this front too
@brogadishu Yep didn’t want to have to clean all that
everybody stuck in a tiny living space has got to be beating themselves up now for not going with a huge mansion instead
@severeanimal Well maybe next time
@jakeriley doubt it
@severeanimal that your last name ?
@severeanimal brenner i think
@JonnyBuswell The next toilet papering
@Hofoogu all part of the gag
thought of a prank to do sometime where you eat all the apples on someone’s apple tree down to the core but without taking them off the tree. they’re all still hanging on it like that
doing way more work from home than i ever did in the office because im showing off for my wife
@MichaelGunEmoji had a few guys tag trillballins before to say i was stealing his bit for mentioning The Mask
@xfiles_season15 Keep your eyes open for it
@blazy_douste thanks. They’ve been good to me
@OGandyg man of your word
@Wonderfull_TIm I’ve been working on the railroad
@OwnenP I’m just hanging on to the ones i had from before
@Bergertron5000 I’ll take your word for it
@Chase_Observes Like one of those little kids with the marshmallows
@Britt2t 🤦‍♂️
@powerfulshampoo used my boredom all up too early
@TheWillieCoxJr walked a lotta miles on them over the years
@AnimeSandwich just gotta “ball park it”
@clint_bing If only
shoulda sat on  this post until the pandemic. lost out on a lot of likes simply because i didn’t want to wait 10 months https://t.co/s7y1DrL7xS
@clint_bing If you know it’s that big why you going here ?
@surfduder i hardly know this guy though
@AlbertDesu guess we just have to find out by peeing ourselves
@jinpaynus no “sword fights” with you buddies
hardest part of social distancing is when there’s a long row of urinals and only one other dude peeing you can’t take the urinal right next to him anymore. you have to take one at the other end now
@cnrgroff That’s right, Carla
@ErectionHaver a straight swap like this is ok
@ParkerPSM not my list. It’s the world health organization’s
WHO recommends only essential face touching. stop all non-essential face touching immediately

Essential:
rubbing eyes
scratching itch

Non-Essential:
touching pinky to lip for dr. evil impression 
moving index finger up &amp; down between lips making “buh dee buh dee buh dee” sound
@_jmarquis @surfduder oh man remember that ?
@WeinerBarf420 you’d have to ask the townspeople!
@surfduder thanks
hope i don’t get coronavirus. don’t wanna be known around town as “the coronavirus guy”

@jeffrauw probably tortoise shell. Depends what shirt i end up wearing
damn. weekend’s almost over. back to quarantine tomorrow
@slapdunk a real “beaut”

@GnarlyWhitehur1 I guess they’re in order
@ub3rlegen Hmm looks like they deleted it

@TheHyyyype Think so
@WeinerBarf420 going the opposite direction on this one. Already done all the hyper gas consumer tweets
@jinpaynus Guess they’re thinking we’ll all be dead by then

@_flyentologist bingo
@jinpaynus they come with the office building when it’s built
@jinpaynus @boss_on_here didn’t want to say it but yeah it is
@JadaWright1700 wherever the mouth is
@boss_on_here if you like smelling that sort of thing
these kinds of pens can kiss my ass https://t.co/2uj4mVIikr
@Protest_Singer yep
@danchovy Ok. Here it goes. What they gonna have square eggs on there ?
@danchovy I can’t remember anything about it now. Need to do some research first
@jinpaynus You’re welcome
@donnie_cakes Aye
@jinpaynus i mean i was aware of it but i thought people would tweet about it for a full 24 hours at least
@jinpaynus This?
https://t.co/VnIWJKPtGo https://t.co/iUjDD4RrKS
@danchovy people were talking about Taco Bell breakfast for like 3 weeks straight
@CharlieVindaloo You’d never know it from Twitter
politics has consumed this place so much that i didn’t even see one tweet about Wendy’s breakfast
@DrGhostbaby now i don’t know about that
@sam_reginald Yep i can hear it
@WeinerBarf420 @sexythunderbunz then he shouldn’t be out at the pumps
@sexythunderbunz Then i back off and say “have at ‘im “
@VerefiedHusband next gallons on me
(stepping in between two dudes about to fight at the gas station) hey we’re all gas purchasers here
@human_millipede same thing on other side!
@SirSandGoblin Not all signs are this small
i feel for women for not having had a female president. reminds me of how men must have felt before george washington
@pnwprimate avoiding anything that looks even remotely like that
not getting the coronavirus by ducking under it and jumping over it
@danielseguinjr I am
you don’t need to worry about the coronavirus if you’re hot
@Wonderfull_TIm Offer’s off the table sorry. Deleted once they were all spoken for
@TeddyRedder Doubt it
@IntegralSolver doing both
@BraOfNachos whatever you’ve got to do
@sissycrypto Thanks
@dannyzyall Both liquids
@Middaughsome that was a long time ago
@Flynah Don’t have to ask me twice
@jinpaynus like to see the wind try to blow this thing off the road
should be legal in baseball if a pitcher’s really feeling it after a strikeout for him to say “alright I’ll give you a 4th shot”
@bryanmarro13 @espn @KingJames @NBA Bad to look at though
@muganga_eric could be unstoppable or whatever but it looks terrible. I hate watching it
@susiemmilligan Nope. Not til i got to the zone
@espn @KingJames @NBA don’t know enough to say if it’s effective or anything but this move seriously looks so stupid
@Ygrene Yeah that’s cool when he does that
@YesNoSuper It wasn’t bad
@Flynah i grabbed this one
@frickntriedrice think it was a 65 mph zone
@ItsPhetz pretty sick zone

@dereknason In case you missed it section

@VerefiedHusband Long but interesting
@michael_raphone Wow that’s my dream job
@LydiaBurrell going to start washing mine twice each time now just to get this percentage up to 62% for men
@michael_raphone I about an hour. You?

@michael_raphone wish i could do that
@braket I’ve done it again
@ialexlambert sometimes
@MichaelSmartGuy Im surprised i never see it used on here
@WeinerBarf420 3 or 4
@MichaelSmartGuy https://t.co/ewu03aV99I https://t.co/g4mCOCq3v9
@lilbirkenstocks will never happen to me
@mcmileable that’s right
@helloyellowmike Make sure i get the best one
@Flynah big fan. do it when i can
most people get to work and just pull into a parking spot. not me. i like to try a few of them out before i make a decision on one
@DadofGabriel Some of the names he’s giving me..I’m surprised
found out this other dad of a kid in my kid’s school class is a dentist. now trying to get the dirt from him which kids in this class have cavities
@GnarlyWhitehur1 Pretty good
@BrendanLaser @DanMentos that didn’t happen
@DanMentos yep. He was there
@sam_reginald and I’ll be the first to admit it
@AlbertDesu that’s right. Then the sock
@militaryhorses big part of why it was better
@jinpaynus And you can never go back
@ceejoyner @extranapkins Solid couple of years
@extranapkins That’s a little early for my taste. Too pun heavy. 2012-2015 was best to me
@kevbaby325 Was the best time i think
remembering what tweeting used to be like in 2014 and 2015
@Strawdocberries thanks
@Cryptoterra he looks like he was like 6’7 when he was young
clothing store saying i can’t go in there naked. trying to explain to them that this will be my first shirt and pants
@cakemittens Maybe I’ll read it then
@cakemittens but not the book
@DJ90sHentai I do
@enragedCORE an absolute classic
@dereknason you’re in the passenger seat?
@ZarathustraMD 😍
@CharlieVindaloo no. this is how everybody gets to work
i bet it’s hard to drive a cement mixer and not just be thinking the whole time about all that cement being mixed in the back
@Bremer_Nick yeah he thinks it funny
@BassoonJokes hehe
@bransonreese : Cool photo I took when I woke up right after Joe Camel hit me with his car https://t.co/JQB4zlrhj3
@BLT_13 I’m on it
@BLT_13 scab from cutting my lip open a week ago
@Funderballz One
@Sean_Halligan_ Guess he can have em! (Chevy guy)
@boss_on_here i think one would do!
@RickVonJaeger hard to blame him. I mean it’s basically instinctive when you see your friends car coming the other way to whip out your phone and get a pic then send it to them
@xceptionalbeast once a year
@PajamaStew Anything’s possible
@JManzielFan69 I bet it’s the former
@JManzielFan69 At least a tank full for each one
@hollyroik @H0LE_SN1FFER I definitely plan to take another one of these pics to post and I’ll stop and get out of the car for the pic
@H0LE_SN1FFER I’ll ask
@H0LE_SN1FFER more dangerous than allowing a guy to get away with hogging this many cars?
hey buddy, save some cars for the rest of us haha https://t.co/WoGAemPoMk
@sawbucklando thanks i let my buddy know
@seinfeldbig a scab on my lip
@PaulBeidel thanks it’s been good to me

@AlbertDesu thanks. Would never take a pic of myself with it but my buddy caught a good one of it this morning
my buddy just sent me this pic he got of me as he passed me going the opposite direction on the roadthis morning. thought i’d share https://t.co/oAaO1TQcwC
@_christina23_ i got the gas
@cuzurt @Mike2020 @SUBWAY That’s right
@Mike2020 @SUBWAY i get their sandwiches
@Old_Marley I’ll ask Bernie for the rights
hypocritical of Bernie to be a socialist and also own a lake house where he communicates by letters through the house’s mailbox and then falls in love with the previous owner who also lives in the lake house in a timeline 2 years earlier
@SorryMomDotGov get a load of this (opens up the truck revealing the mail)
@Bremer_Nick This is for my car
@jinpaynus Just a little bit
@jaycatsjensen It’s new to me
@Joe_Fraser Probably 3
@PajamaStew you’re old fashioned
@g_e_d_i I cannot. Sorry

@ptrevre One or two?
@baby20o0 the king
@blood_orphan I always do
headed to the gas station to purchase their signature product: Gas
@DrewskiPalewski because it was just added to the list
@WoodFeels thanks i put a lot of time and effort into it
@IllyBocean I think so
@IllyBocean you just need to try them all, including these new 42, at any point in your life before you die. You won’t die immediately after but there will be a consequence if you haven’t tried them all and you happen to die
@kpducc there’s 42 so the odds are good
@DomCarterAgain so if you make sure you are constantly eating you’ll live forever ?
@DomCarterAgain that true?
imagine you think you can finally sit down and relax now after youve tried all of the foods and then this.. https://t.co/8ztbGOBDRz
@Flynah prap. classic
@adamxii it’s a geep
@jef_fh @lovethatmoon at the Grand Canyon

@TankertonLatch no cell service
@NoFuturist canyon. watch your step
@TimKania no I’m done with them
@danjan13 heard it was done by water
@WokLft One of the best
@LadyBroseph for a canyon
@happydansko In the flesh

@neonsinatra Not to me
@ItsPhetz Would never
@rudetanks @NotUrplePingo that’s pretty hungry
@Mike_Bianchi i don’t live here. I live in a house that says HOUSE on the front of it
@coryandtreezy @MichaelSmartGuy @jinpaynus Guess that settles it
@MichaelSmartGuy @jinpaynus Let’s see what you’ve got
@lunch_enjoyer me as well

@jinpaynus @MichaelSmartGuy someone’s gotta
@ruinedurnight Pretty cool
@extranapkins Our boy
@jinpaynus @MichaelSmartGuy 😈
@MichaelSmartGuy Just waiting for someone to say this isn’t true
@blood_orphan This and the Pizza Hut: Home of the Pizza are why Albuquerque is the goat
that’s right https://t.co/h48C8RdyLv
if your hands are wet and you get a hair on there that’s it. That things on there for good
@sam_reginald quite a bit of space if I’m imagining it right
@sam_reginald just broke ground
@Flynah Thanks Ian
@danjan13 That’d be cool
@napranica Aww shucks
@colinoscopies egg on his face
(to guy who’s lunch looks a little bigger than mine) you think you’re hungrier than me dude? fuck you
@Ivan69270579 Pretty much. Like 4 times a day
@Ivan69270579 yeah it’s this toilet!
@RDPullins @Probgoblin Yeah some movies age so much better that’d be interesting
@jinpaynus Didnt win this year
winner of best picture should move on to next years oscars to defend their title. give the new movies a shot at “the champ”
@pharmasean Probably true
@surfduder Never done it
so cool to see a movie that you’ve seen win an award
@mrdarklord965 got some jeans cooling on the window sill
(said in a way like you have some cookies in the oven) got some jeans in the dryer
@TheHyyyype You’re welcone
@ItsPhetz @jinpaynus It’s time to move on from the oceans
@furnsey guess so
@jinpaynus @ItsPhetz not a fan
@ItsPhetz Now there’s one “fish” i like
@elevatyler It’d now be in our own backyards (at the condos)
@ItsPhetz not important to me
@MattIsATwitNow probably not in the long run
@ImMichaelBrown He did but he deleted his reply and i think even his whole account now. But i think it was something about all of us dying or something
still my favorite reply i ever got on here was after i said that we should dry up the oceans and build condos out there a guy earnestly replied that that wouldnt be a good idea
@THLCarmichael never did
@THLCarmichael nah i was always really nice to jean game kid
@StrasiTunity That’s Pete
@jinpaynus https://t.co/TPPm0cPSqm https://t.co/fAUFN5jWCG
@juniorshabidoo remind me of another type of kid i can do a pete tweet about thanks
@dannyzyall Thin red line
@jinpaynus I knew that kid
@robertisnthere Yeah i did that too
@Flynah You can’t. It’s there for good
@planoneck Haha
@JaunNicely i did know those kids (poor but great athlete) but they didn’t wear jeans to games in my experience
@furnsey @DanMentos that is a type of kid
@Hofoogu That kid rocks to me
@tdtbaa All bits are
@AB_7A @DanMentos hmm to me jean kid is not exclusive to gay kids
@tdtbaa it’s a good bit
@jothdr that one is too on the nose i think
@DanMentos this is the one i think has the best chance of landing
@jinpaynus too early to call
@mgbaca Las Vegas nv
@mgbaca I miss it. Cool town
@mgbaca You live in abq ?
@JaronBirch yeah it could be
@JaronBirch Sure
@cup4water I hated it. Sorry

@BuckyIsotope Only needed to know if you were going to use it but thanks
@ErectionHaver Yeah
@husbandsrevenge I will
@Flynah Noticed that just this morning
@human_millipede gotta stay warm is what i always say
@Jawrshwah @chiweethedog i guess i got there first then
@Jawrshwah @chiweethedog did he do this video before i made my tweet?
@SolarDomina @napranica Getting out of it now
@vegasvin @IdkImean Young at heart
@Wonderfull_TIm Good luck finding one of those without a persons hand attached to it!
@jinpaynus @brogadishu Haha. I think maybe Jesse farrar?
@IdkImean @vegasvin Yeah i feel young still
@IdkImean I was actually 35 in this one
@jinpaynus @brogadishu Didn’t even think about that
@IdkImean Wow 😍
@IdkImean @vegasvin but i appreciate you moving this one back to 35 🙏
@IdkImean @vegasvin this one is very good. 39
@brogadishu didn’t even think about that
back in my day we had to jerk off to the bra section of the sears catalog that came in the mail now kids these days can just get right on their phones and google “bra section of sears catalog”
@tbabbs27 Looks kind of like a heart
@crampedskunkman Will do
@napranica didn’t love it tbh
@tweetpittman It did
@VerefiedHusband damn i hope so too
@vegasvin Yeah. How old do i look here?
@sam_reginald this guy can really hold his gas
@GnarlyWhitehur1 he took this on his iPhone 4
@Gamplayr he’s a good driver. I trust him to be in his lane
@alstra78 Now that’d be something
@surfduder you would know better than me
@Wonderfull_TIm and a fine evening it is
@sam_reginald time to treat yourself
@holly_mahan Thanks for checking out the pic
@jinpaynus @brogadishu Great stuff
@brogadishu just take a quick glance
@BrockWorkman yep. Egg on their face

@harmlessbaby2 you bet
@THENoneadidal Yeah
@THENoneadidal yeah
@napranica might spend some time basking in it to show my love
@lordbeef Now ya tell me! Haha
@stanquilizer Yeah some of us want to see the whole thing
@jinpaynus Pretty cool to see it this close
@human_millipede Mine is like the sun with its makeup on
@blood_orphan Just make your hand into a visor over your eyes and have a look
@fart may not be as close up as the ones yesterday but same thing
@MrQuallzin Its one of the one suns
@GnarlyWhitehur1 It’s all pretend
@glittersquirrel i think so
@sam_reginald I haven't said this in awhile but I really mean it: have a good summer
@mamennenga HAs too many likes to delete
@sam_reginald Sam I hate to break it to you but you've gone and done it again
@sam_reginald me: when the gas hit &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;
@sam_reginald deceptive angle. dont wanna get the last guys germs
@mnpaul47 @allawati Moby dick
@jinpaynus That one wasn’t as popular. don’t think it exists anymore
@VerefiedHusband i heard that
@eddiemcdonough I wiped it with my sleeve
@Wonderfull_TIm glug glug glug
@ErectionHaver yep. Lightweight
@doctorfunkymd that’s true
@IllyBocean To make it look like your dick is about to drink the gas
@LANGSTALANG This ain’t your fathers gas guzzler
@surfduder maybe better go do a new one
@GuillermoSig couldn’t let it stay dead
@napranica yeah something about the other just fits better. Looks more relaxed or something
@pedrorossob Also good
@pedrorossob Not sure but it’s good
@danbrosgoes Ok
@Choplogik gonna stick to water from here on out thanks
@upsidedowntrash the genuine article
@OwnenP Been destroyed
@spacej_me @sadvil Not good
@spacej_me @sadvil you ever have a patient come in who drank gas?
@spacej_me @sadvil and you’re a doctor right?
@sadvil yeah i bet it tastes really good
@LydiaBurrell uh oh
@lordbeef ahhhh
@lunch_enjoyer hell how about two?
@jinpaynus “He’s back!”
@andrewtabs these ones i did because of a job thing but sometimes just because i hate them
@lordbeef Can’t imagine i won’t
@jondeno2 yeah
@dascool23 i imagine it’s got some bad stuff in it
@LydiaBurrell Guess we’ll never know
@xTreeLine that’s right. first time is right now
@barstoolCIA Not another one!
@napranica @custardloaf there were some good ones the last 3 times i did it
@freshcleanup thanks! Happy to be a part of it!
@sam_reginald can you come do this reply again so i can do mine 
https://t.co/YCoLVjpH0B https://t.co/DZ0gbdkWCf
@gojarbe this time for good probably
@melip0ne Literally Couldn’t have done it without you
@gojarbe Oh that right you brought that up in a previous reply. Nice callback
@gojarbe thanks i don’t have it anymore. this is from 2016
@melip0ne In the flesh
@JimmyJazz1968 That doesn’t sound right
@melip0ne Well we’ll well look what the cat dragged in
@braket That’s the one!
@Wifeneeder I definitely feel a little weird today
@jinpaynus hey you’re right
@jinpaynus too busy. The one i did in 2016 was at a closed down one. Even then i didnt like any of the pics from my “first shoot” so i went back a second time and a lady at the hair salon across the street said loudly “he’s back” to the other ladies working there
@tastefactory gonna steal this
@coryandtreezy You got it
@WoodFeels too safe for me
@melip0ne you might be my only chance
@WoodFeels would you prefer i do the right turn one again instead??
if any of you saved the photo of me from my pretending to drink gas post from 2016 (not the 2015 one please) could you send it to me. Would love to do the post but not going to go to a gas station today
@PaulBeidel same
@troop_respecter I will now!
@_flyentologist Adding it to the list
@YesNoSuper There are separate posts for both of these you are supposed to go to Paul
@boss_on_here Thanks
@mamennenga found the post. Wasn’t too hard. Thanks
@minustheair The best part
@UncleBolton I won’t try and stop you
@erik_normal ok. Noted
@surfduder There’s always someone coming in here with a “great”
@WAVDL Wouldn’t dream of it
@NamelessRanger adding it to the list
@barfeye Adding that to the list
@Karstan That’s a good thought. Or one for each day of the year
@lukefinney5 can’t make any promises
@DrCatus Middle of the week
@THENoneadidal i will with what’s left of it (most of it)
@jinpaynus skin always sticking hard to those slats
@70Ceeks I wouldn’t know
@p_o_b_ he was an early blu ray adopter
in my early 20s i went with a friend by this dude’s house and his living room setup was a tv and two of these he dragged in from the apartment complex pool https://t.co/o9y2afKUsj
@Flynah Nope it’ll all come from your net income
@allawati I’ve read 1 book about a sea captains quest to get revenge on the giant sperm whale that bit his leg off
@rudetanks not surprised
@geniuscowboy That’s for sure
@Fathead4A 👀
@josiahhughes Man, i envy you guys up there
@SuspendedSunset @Probgoblin wonder who will win
@geniuscowboy wonder who will win
@rudetanks That’s pretty crazy since we’re on opposite sides of the country
@josiahhughes everything is ever since trump and all
@husbandsrevenge seems like shaking him would help maybe
@SirSandGoblin yep
@evlbzltyr yeah
@josiahhughes In the glasses or the guy?
@rudetanks because i posted this or you already were?
thinking about a guy who’s transitions lenses are just constantly transitioning back and forth from light to dark no matter if he’s inside or outside
@Sipsdad That’s right
@ItsPhetz you misspelled We The Viewers
the oscars are coming up. who’ll walk away with the night’s biggest prize: The Oscar
@CharlieVindaloo @clint_bing if they pick it up I’ll do it there
@clint_bing Can i show your reply to thevtv networks?
@Flynah yes
https://t.co/oa1WyXjItq

@AlbertDesu Yes. My Winnie the Pooh red shirt no pants
@NuttaaaButtaaa and would be all the time if i was a cartoon character

Destroyer - Kaputt
@susiemmilligan netflix
@Tommytoughstuff You got it
@Flynah not me
@PajamaStew Red
@DanMentos it rocks
@Tommytoughstuff i bet there is

teaching my sons that it’s a man’s role in the home to do bits that are only funny to himself
@charles_chimney It is
@clint_bing yet we still do it
@randypriceiv I’d like that
@wrappedstallion It’s one of phil collins
@buddcheegs Yeah i might check out some of his others that I’ve known about and heard my whole life
@sledgehammertoe I did actually but would love to be shown “in your eyes” and “i can’t dance”
@mrbrenthoover yeah that’s the feeling i got is that he was recently “shown” phil and loved it and is wanting to pass it on
@surfduder yeah he might have thought I’d heard of phil but never got around to checking out his songs
@legokillermoth This time listening was pretty good
@surfduder what ?
@sad_tree I’ve heard it many time before but this listen was really good
coworker asked me what kind of music i liked and then in that conversation asked if id heard of phil collins and after then even after i answered that i know phil collins later this afternoon he said “oh i wanted to show you a phil collins song” and turned on in the air tonight
@CassiusConnor Thank you. Happy new year
@AlbertDesu Right back behind the wheel tomorrow
@patrickkeefe if I’m honest..no
@GnarlyWhitehur1 I’m just the one on the left

@clint_bing that shit be hittin different
@realCarolineCon Pretty good.

@ithinkitsdanny Four door sedan
@YourComicMuse a few others did as well. Maybe it was better that way
@jenlaw_11 That’d would be somethin
@rwoodsmall Happy to show it to you
@NotUrplePingo i did it again
@YourComicMuse This was supposed to be “who said it’s not”
@ialexlambert Sorry. “without you”
@_flyentologist Got another 2 of em coming up

@WeinerBarf420 Not bad (if you like traffic)

@acomplexcollin Remember that?
@IllyBocean say that to my face!
@DanMentos Thanks Dan. It’s been a good run
@DanMentos this is the one
@lordbeef just put turkey on a roll to go !

@YesNoSuper no problem Paul. Be on the lookout
@pogsaregood keep your eyes peeled for one summer 2020
@meatbod Think I’ve got one more in me
@wokesweetie I owe it to you guys
@wokesweetie never saw it. Wouldn’t be fair to tweet about it
@wokesweetie I think I’ve done them all
@meatbod you have a bunch more?
excited to do a good post in a few days
i have one last good post to do later this week
@ShanusMcAnus pretty good!
@BernieSanders ridiculous...they should be paying twice that !
@tastefactory so true, pat
i never wash my jeans  because they’re dirty. i wash them because the waist has stretched a little loose and needs tightening back up
@Kelvinlyle1975 a lot of ways you can go with it
@DrGhostbaby thought you were serious
@HiddenPinky @punmagnate Might steal that
@jaywking and laugh
@jdcoolguy You heard me
@CharlieVindaloo Not sure but don’t think so
@brogadishu 😩
@brogadishu good year for eye sight related bits

@miles_beau That’s what im going for
@upsidedowntrash You got it
getting up early before there are a bunch of cars and hoards of people to get pictures of my costco. beautiful https://t.co/W94xDNtUKu
@wingoz damn look at all those unmanaged loads
@coryandtreezy because he could reach the balls at the top of the truck
when an nba player is not playing a game due to “load management” that means it’s their night to manage a crew of guys unloading a truck full of a shipment of new basketballs
@shrekpisssIave No. Denny never missed a day of school.
@bananamanzero always killed with me
@Hack2theFuture2 even the kids in the movie thought it was the funniest
@juniorshabidoo not a problem
@Flynah And eat it!
thinking about my friend’s bit where he would tell every Denny’s waitress “i went to school with Denny”
every time i invite my racist uncle over to talk politics we end up making a thanksgiving meal
@human_millipede That’s for me to know and you to find out
@serious_adult lol
going to write one of those “how to talk to your racist uncle at thanksgiving” articles but in a “how to talk to your crush” kind of way
@markeithaspence it’s to clean the candy
@Skoog be here before you know it
@GarbageField Thanks!
@pharmasean Im gonna do it all on nov. 28
@JayJayerJayest as long as you dont mind if i come as well
@shrekpisssIave I’m not going anywhere
@Flynah When does that start?
@jinpayn In a sense
@mooncult The grand daddy
big meal coming up this month
@repeatifdesired Makes me want to call them again
@tdtbaa It sucks
@VerefiedHusband @LindsayHoyle_MP @mattvbrady he stole my tweet
@OpenChnls Yeah i need to go sometime
@WeinerBarf420 The inarguably greatest of all time
@Cole_Millerr That’s right
@jinpayn I’ll probably go eventually
@sarahlindish I didn’t actually go in. Is it just a bunch of pinball tables you can play?
@adamxii I’d have to go in to be able to answer  this
going to see all the greats https://t.co/dhI2gxGdC9
@adelinesamano 🔥
@katwiley123 It’s to clean the candy
@katwiley123 do you really wanna know?
@ciarzard27 you’ll lose
@anitabfit @TxGuerrero1 They rock
@Choplogik Just a light rinse separately on 100 + pieces every year for me
@shrekpisssIave I’m going to give you two pieces this year for this
@IanTShanks People will see the tape from the street outside my house and not come?
@pupusasboi getting a good, proper toe splay is important
@AlbertDesu just saw this. Good to see people talking about my toes and sandals over there too
@chrissyteigen just seeing this now because i just barely got done cleaning them all. you are very welcome
@beefsauce2 Chacos, baby!
@MakeupbyRocky Wears holes in your socks to do that
@WElRDAL You want a video of me doing all 100 or so pieces of candy?
@SaffronWright read the caption
@shesindi anything i could do to change your mind?
@Max_Bannister I’ll tell you what confirms I’m a nonce.. you’re stupid face
@LordPaulSwift1 why do you wash anything? to get it clean
@GorgeousRocker7 The wax makes them basically water proof
@SwampDaddy6 I’ll get more trick or treaters than you
@Chealaaaa_ good mama to make sure her kids candy had been washed
@vopore0n That’s right. Those who don’t wash the candy
@Mrsjoyjones me washing the candy for Halloween night
@pancakes0101 Exactly the same way
@youaremydounia Don’t want the candy to taste like soap
@alGridge Cmon man
@TimboXIXLXI In your dreams!
@MariahJRose last one for this years bowl
@queuebey Yes. If you start early enough. This is actually for Halloween 2020
@alleon713 I’m still going
@_WhoaaBeautiful 🙏
@queuebey What is it?
@Michelle_Jacobs So clean
@steffofthemoon i ate the Reese’s
@VickyNunes they won’t know because the tape is clear
@VickyNunes explained in the caption
@kathleenburke97 @brydustin it’s not duct tape it’s scotch tape
@WFKARS @brydustin it’s scotch tape which is clear
@GorgeousRocker7 ate the cup. No waste
@vboneil You heard me
@jp_anderson318 I explained it in the tweet caption
@TxGuerrero1 chacos
@ry_guuy The eggs are for Easter this is a pumpkin
@sam_reginald 2015 ass toes
@sam_reginald send sandal toe combo link
@TheeVapnadomr very carefully
@nepp10k that’s correct
@sasscatfrass Thanks
@_freelei I ate it. No waste
@TheeVapnadomr Knowing that some people don’t wash their candy?
@danasul1tan Chaco sandals
@GregPacknett You know i had to do it to em
@BiffleWall No other way
@Kay_Kay57 I ate the Reese’s
@TENDERpbj I ate it
@serious_adult Until tonight had no idea anybody didn’t do this
@AUcomeback First legitimate complaint about the video
@kyledawolf1 @fauxlacine Yes they warned us about people who don’t wash their candy
@rudetanks candy warsh
@Asoka_raj I know it’s late. I’ll finish tomorrow. Thanks
@brydustin But how would you even know since it’s resealed with tape
@sam_reginald Sam some people are not happy about the toes/sandals
@mnderekvang 🙏
@erik_normal germs on the towel
@sam_6065 i know. its a little early
@natethegreat118 yes because a lot of people don’t do this
@jinpayn I don’t remember tweeting this but sounds like i was just reporting the news
@TenaciousGrace i know. i shoulda waited til tomorrow night
@OfficialCheese6 @parsfarce thought you don’t need soap on fruit veggies or candy
@JimmyJazz1968 Don’t think i said one word in this video
@jinpayn i sure hope so. It’s a lot of work
getting the candy washed and ready to go for halloween night https://t.co/3eXPTbky5W
@Flynah It’s all of our house
@CornOnTheGoblin never heard of them
like kevin mccallister in home alone believes that all mall santas work for the real santa i believe all people who dress up as jason from friday the 13th aren’t the real jason but they work for him
@DrGhostbaby Yeah After they run it through their lab they’ll know
@Thoirdealbhaigh : I am a tiny man: when my son was born, the doctor handed me to him
@Choplogik truck’s on its way
@sam_reginald doing it now
@sam_reginald Just thought of this: send vasectomy link
@sam_reginald Sunday I’m available (Saturday i can’t because I’m already getting a vasectomy with someone else)
@MichaelSmartGuy looks like I’ve done it again (irl edition)
@bananamanzero @worldmindd Wow thanks
@YesNoSuper Thanks paul
@washburn647 Thanks
@worldmindd Thanks
@blordicai Thanks
taking a post vasectomy semen sample to the lab and thinking about doing a bit where when the person calls me up i give them the sample cup and say “im hoping you guys can tell me what this stuff is”
@jinpayn is that true?
@juckcussuru It’s shorter and being cracked open
@fart exactly right, Jon
@helbpful it’s a little shorter and cracked open
@yerpalmildsauce I’ve got no proof
this truck is carrying 6 bud lights exactly this size inside there https://t.co/pm2DEYPJas
@BassoonJokes Try demanding to see it
before eintstein nobody could get E to equal MC2 and no one since has been able to get it to equal MC3. his record will never be broken
@AlbertDesu Thank you
@MyCologne2011 sounds like a great town
@MyCologne2011 Thank you
@tinocoallday no
@self_robot that’s right
@MyCologne2011 you wish
@Vertigo_One I’m happy! and at a brightly lit traffic light
@cum_boss always at a light like this one
@ub3rlegen Me too
@xMancerNecro There’s one nearby
@Flynah crew neck. I don’t wear Vs
@HiiImZach thanks Zach. I’ve got that “favorite stoplight glow”
@surfduder Mark is cool. Thanks
@Jackson75700219 gotta go with what i know: Costco, Netflix and the mask
@AvoidedUniform you’re only allowed in once every time you present your card at the door
@ItsPhetz Nope. Hotdogs as well
if you show your Costco card to the person at the front entrance they’ll let you in to the special section where they  have all of the items in bulk
@brogadishu Haha
costco card checker: welcome to costco . will you be buying in bulk with us today ?
this seems like a weird selling point for a magician https://t.co/ncaiOL0Ow3
@CharlieVindaloo Was a different time a month ago
@MikeJon30654311 @samelpan Thank you
@dascool23 Please do
@erik_normal I can
(passing by professional photographer taking pictures of a model) want me to get one with both of you in it?
@surfduder thanks for noticing
@clint_bing Yes
@colinoscopies probably dinner for me
lunch isn’t my favorite meal but it’s the one I’m best at
(to photographer taking professional photos of a family) want me to get one with all of you in it?
@dannyteardrop An elite group
@dannyteardrop Good to see a fellow basal cell guy. I’ve had 4 of those guys removed.
@shrekpisssIave Someone must
bro, you’re posting cringe. im so jealous
@_flyentologist Prap
@CowlonFullerton Prap
@sam_reginald Love those nights when it isn’t
@Cam_Dog Not enough
@jinpayn Don’t worry about it
@p_o_b_ Brush my teeth twice a day
glad my dentist office puts their phone number on my tooth brush so i remember to call them every time i brush my teeth https://t.co/HxItJCqWAi
@Fancy_Dad nice photoshop
@DinkMagic https://t.co/eiXHzXd7hh
@prawn_meat : moby dick is a great reminder that hunting a rare whale can be challenging at times
@sam_reginald Now that’s messed up
@Gamplayr Recently. Yeah
@sam_reginald You just go ahead with the barf?
@clint_bing Said that it said “bass”
@surfduder don’t think so
@japanimation Not going well
@shrekpisssIave Can’t hurt to try
my boss just walked in on me ripping a piece of paper in half with the word "Boss" written on it
@slapdunk Gonna give it another go today
@Chase_Observes glad to hear it
@machinegunfuton I’m taking tenfold right now
@kpducc So much better than throwing up though
@BrigBrallerBand not sure. Maybe mrs vickies
i hate barfing so much. whenever i feel nauseous and need to barf i concentrate really hard and reverse its track into diarrhea
just found out about george w bush today. was too busy dealing with the rules in my own dad’s house to really look into him at the time
@BrendanLaser I won the internet
@RickVonJaeger you got that right
@jinpayn I’m sure
@BrendanLaser I’m very both
I’ve never posted anything on here that could even be considered a “take” about anything other than salt and vinegar chips
@nervous_Dork Thank you!
@cum_boss Its not looking good for me
@nervous_Dork you saying because i won’t be able to lift the rock i should “get back to work”?
@WeinerBarf420 no eggs
@WeinerBarf420 maybe a medium size boulder
my boss just said if I can lift this big rock over my head we can all go home early
been waiting for my boss to wear this plain black t shirt to work again so i can say “hey simon cowell, what is it ricky gervais day?” because when i thought it last time i was still to new at the job to feel comfortable saying it
@kpducc that’s why i went to the parents guide first was to see if the joker has sex
@pattymo wow i thought that was on purpose
@Ygrene A key component of my move is avoiding eye contact and looking busy so if the coworker notices me they think “looks like he’s got a lot to wrap up in the car before he goes  in”
@brogadishu @ItsPhetz i just try to think about the paycheck when stuff like that happens
@ItsPhetz @brogadishu Why we have to work with people like this?
@brogadishu that’s super messed up.  One time when i was sitting in my car waiting for a coworker to go in so i didn’t have to walk with her she came and knocked on my car window to walk in with her
@dunzy18 Hate that kinda stuff especially first thing in the morning
@Rezuaq that sounds nice
@MattIsATwitNow That would be a problem
they should stagger all of the start times at work for employees by a few minutes each morning so nobody has to see each other in the parking lot or walk in at the same time
pulled up to work at the same time as a coworker this morning and thought about if we both did my move of waiting in the car until the coworker gets out and goes into the building to avoid having to walk in together and we both just stayed in our cars all day
@420ForDickPain if you’d like it to
@420ForDickPain Yeah

@fob_dylan how often do you shower?
@mbrosie2 On second thought, I don’t.
@mbrosie2 I wish the size of my balls was 10.8 centimeters (diameter) so they could rest perfectly within a regulation golf hole.
The worst part about going to the bathroom in public is having to pretend to wash your hands after taking a shit.
@dlicj : sure Spirit Halloween is only open one month out of the whole year but you can’t say that they don’t pick the best month of the year for that kind of business to be open

@fob_dylan whistles loudly, fireworks shoot from top of head, pants loudly as tongue hangs out of mouth, wipes comically large bead of sweat from forehead, clears throat, straightens tie, combs hair* Ahem, you look very lovely. (2/2)
@fob_dylan *jaw drops to floor, eyes pop out of sockets accompanied by trumpets, heart beats out of chest, awooga awooga sound effect, pulls chain on train whistle that has appeared next to head as steam blows out, slams fists on table, rattling any plates, bowls or silverware, (1/2)

@DeepLeffen : Sometimes, when I'm having a bad day, I just sit outside and think, "if this were my last day on earth, would I want to spend it feeling like this?" That helps me put my problems in perspective so I can get back to what really matters in life: hentai with the boysssss.

@davedanieldave For clarification, the thirdback didn't have a jersey, which is a violation of NFL rules. The rest of his teammates realized how well they could perform without him and they decided his position wasn't necessary, thus cutting him from the team and his role from the sport.
@davedanieldave If I recall correctly threeeighthsback is still a thing in rugby though
@davedanieldave Pretty sure this has to do with issues that arose when computerized jersey-printing came around. Story goes that someone decided to write "thirdback" as "1/3-back" and it came printed off as "0.33333333..." The printer wouldn't stop so they had to cut the position.
@fob_dylan Good question!
@M150Kendrick Pro Tip!: you can get wider by wearing more shirts!
@M150Kendrick but if we’re being honest 45-50cm shoulder width is probably average
@M150Kendrick Aw Josh don’t be insecure, you’re the perfect width already :)
@fob_dylan The defending team needs 11 people as well because it wouldn’t be fair if they had more or less people than the attacking team.
@fob_dylan I often find myself asking this question as well. If we break it down, we see that we need one person to throw the ball (quarterback) and one person to catch the ball (receiver), but the other nine are a bit more confusing. My guess is that they’re there for fun, not sure though.
Gonna do an AMA! If you have any questions or confusions about football/football rules feel free to leave a reply and I’ll see if I can’t clear it up (please football questions only).
